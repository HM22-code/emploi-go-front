# We Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

 - Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
 - If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
 - If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
 - Ensure the test suite passes.
 - Make sure your code lints.
 - Issue that pull request!
